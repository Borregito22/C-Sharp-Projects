# C-Sharp-Projects

## Introduction
This repository will contain projects created for my C# and .NET course at The Tech Academy. Here are a few of my projects.

## Projects:<br>
Car Insurance<br>
Shipping Quote<br>
Current DateTime<br>

## Car Insurance<br>
This project functions as a quote esimator for auto insurance. It is a MVC web app. It takes in user input based on policy information, calculates a quote utilizing business logic, and displays the quote to the user. There's also an amdin page that allows the staff to view all of the insurance quotes that have been generated.

## Shipping Quote<br>
This project will generate a quote for shipping a package. It's a simple console application that generates the quote based on user input. An if statement is implemented to inform the user if the package is too large or too heavy for the company to ship.

## Current DateTime<br>
This is a very simple console application that will ask the user for a number. It will then print what time it will be in that amount of hours. I use a conversion and .AddHours() to get the time.
